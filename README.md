***The aim of the program is to solve first order, linear differential equations written in the form "y' = Ay + P(x)" using runge-kutta-4th method. Written in C***

• Firstly, it will ask for how many terms are in the equation, at that step even if your equation does not have a term with y variable you should consider adding 1 to the number of terms. 

• And do not forget, since it is a linear ODE y is a function of x. So y0 is actually y(x0).
